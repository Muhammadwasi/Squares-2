# Memory Game
This is a Squares 2 written in `Java Processing 2.2.1`<br/>
I made this game similar to [Squares 2 by Gavin Shapiro](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/games/squares2)


It contains three screens with background `Music`:<br/>
1. Main Screen:<br/><br/>
  It has two options `Play`, and `Help`.<br/><br/>

## Game Rules:
1. Don't touch red squares.
1. Don't touch red circles otherwise player's score will be decreased by 1000 and speed will be increased.
1. Touch black squares.
1. Touch black circles; it will increase score by 1000 and decrease speed.
## How to play?
In order to play this game, you have to install Processing version 2. It will give errors in `Processing 3` because some music libraries have been removed in version 3. In order to run it on `Processing v3`, remove the `minim` library.
